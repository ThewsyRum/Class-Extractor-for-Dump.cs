# Class Extractor for Dump.cs

I didn't want to keep testing various possible classes until I found the correct one for a game. So, I created this script to extract the classes from the dump.cs file and then feed them into an AI to help me with that, and it worked.

## Requirements

- Python3 installed
    
## Usage/Examples

```
$ python3 class_extractor.py
... Enter dump path: Downloads/dump.cs
... Enter output path: Output.txt
... Enter class types: public|private

$ Extraction completed! 6614 classes were saved in 'Output.txt'.
```
